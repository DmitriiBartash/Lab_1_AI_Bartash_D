# üß± Block Manipulation Simulator with Hook System

This project simulates a simple 2D grid world where numbered blocks can be stacked, grabbed, moved, and dropped using a virtual hook. It is designed for experimenting with basic environment modeling and user interaction, and serves as a foundation for AI agents or command interpretation systems.

## üéØ Features

- Add blocks to a column in a gravity-like stacking system
- Grab blocks with a virtual hook (if accessible)
- Move the hook horizontally across the grid
- Drop blocks onto stacks
- Maintain a full action log
- Ask natural-language-like questions in Russian about actions:
  - "–ö—É–¥–∞ –¥–æ–±–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω –±–ª–æ–∫ (1)?"
  - "–ö–∞–∫ –∫—Ä—é–∫ –∑–∞—Ö–≤–∞—Ç–∏–ª –±–ª–æ–∫ (2)?"
  - "–ö—É–¥–∞ –ø–µ—Ä–µ–º–µ—â–∞–ª—Å—è –∫—Ä—é–∫?"
  - "–ö—É–¥–∞ –±—Ä–æ—à–µ–Ω –±–ª–æ–∫ (3)?"
  - "–ü–æ—á–µ–º—É –Ω–µ —É–¥–∞–ª–æ—Å—å –∑–∞—Ö–≤–∞—Ç–∏—Ç—å –±–ª–æ–∫ (4)?"

## üí° Project Purpose

This educational simulator introduces key ideas related to:

- Environment modeling
- Discrete action-based simulations
- Logging and reasoning about system state
- Primitive natural language question handling (command parsing)

While not a full AI system, it lays the groundwork for developing an AI agent that could reason, plan, or learn from actions in a defined environment.
